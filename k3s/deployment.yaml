# The Images are  about 200M [2].  The php-fpm image  does not seem to
# bring a proxy and  does not speak http on its  port 9000. The Apache
# image ist called "legacy" OTOH. It does serve content though.
#
# When going through the installation specify "root" as the MySQL root
# password and "idoit-db" as the  hostname for the MySQL server. Cross
# check below if these comment get out of date.
#
# It is unclear if it makes any  sense to put that data into a volume.
# What of that ist supposed to be persistent state?
#
#   Each  i-doit  container  has  one default  volume  containing  the
#   complete  installation  directory: /var/www/html.  This  directory
#   includes the  source code, cache files,  uploaded files, installed
#   add-ons, custom translation files, etc.
#
# There seem to be a generated config.php, maybe more ...
